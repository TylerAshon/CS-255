Business Requirements and System Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project aimed to design an online system for booking practice exams and on-road training sessions to enhance student success rates for driving license exams. The client, DriverPass, sought a comprehensive platform that addresses gaps in current student preparation by providing real-time practice and training.

What did you do particularly well?
I excelled in defining clear functional and nonfunctional requirements, ensuring that the system’s objectives were well-articulated and aligned with user needs. Additionally, I created an intuitive user interface design that caters to the varying technical backgrounds of students, instructors, and administrators.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the user interface section to include more detailed wireframes and user flow diagrams. This would enhance clarity on user interactions and provide a visual guide to how users navigate the system, improving the overall design process.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I gathered user feedback and analyzed current pain points in exam preparation to inform the system’s features, such as simulated exams and scheduling options. Considering user needs is vital because it ensures the system is user-friendly and effective, ultimately leading to higher satisfaction and engagement.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach software design using an agile methodology, focusing on iterative development and regular user feedback to refine features. In the future, I would implement user personas and journey mapping to better understand user interactions and needs, leading to a more targeted design process.
